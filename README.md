Requirements
Code each of the following tags below to create an HTML page to look the same as the UAT Space Program test page (black and white one) pictured above.

Doctype
HTML Tags
Head Tags

Header text
Paragraph tags
Add an alert (any kind of your choice)
Once you have created the page, add a launch sequence for takeoff.  To do this, use the HTML file you created above. Then using JavaScript in the HTML file, display a count from 10 to 0 in one second increments, then print out a message that says “Blastoff" when the timer says zero!

Do not use an alert message, just print to the screen.

There are many ways to do this, one way is using JavaScript code like the following:

document.getElementById("DisplayCountdown").innerHTML = countdown;
 
You will need to create the variable initialize it to 10. 
You will decrement currTme by 1. 
Then you will repeat this 10 times (cut and paste).  Later we’ll use loops so you don’t have to cut and paste. 
After the countdown reaches zero, print Blastoff!
Create a nice look and feel for the user.
Comment above almost every line of your code
Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.

OR

Submit a link to your GitHub repo (see below if you have not set this up yet). 

GitHub (https://github.com/ (Links to an external site.)) is used as a software repository (repo for short). It is a place to store and distribute code for teams of people developing the software. 

For coding assignments, you can:

create a specific repo for the assignment
make the repo public
submit the location of that repo as the submission for the assignment
